# Elasticsearch-8.x-Cookbook
Elasticsearch 8.x Cookbook, published by Packt

Many scripts inside the repository are using curl and bash to populate the Elasticsearch.
As Elasticsearch 8.x is secured by default, you need to provide you elasticsearch credential in environment variables.

```bash
export ES_USER=elastic
export ES_PASSWORD="QkDupr-yCGPQ8G+_4Jsb"
```
